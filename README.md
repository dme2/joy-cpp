A fairly straightforaward implementation of the joy programming language.

compile with: g++ joy.cpp --std=c++17 -o joy (or just type make). Tested on Linux and macOS.

This is still very much a work in progress. Not all primitives are implemented yet, but most of the examples in the tutorial should work fine.
